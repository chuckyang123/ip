Using CHATGPT 5 for coding 

The time is saved a lot as no need hardcoding everything js need to tell want to do and in which way
The time is saved at least 1.5h with helping of AI

But the problem is for like tests and error handing you need to do it yourself to get everything tested  and every case considered
When encountering some cases the AI can not help debugging for text errors and some small error ike space can not be detected, you need to find out yourself and you
may need think on your own in string finding need include space or not. With AI it  is a more design work not duplicate working.
